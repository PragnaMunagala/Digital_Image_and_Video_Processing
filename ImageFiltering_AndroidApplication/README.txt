Project 2
Group 7

Group members: Pragna Munagala, Manimozhi Ramasamy

############## Introduction ##############
In this project, an image processing app is created by extending the basic touch color app using android and opencv. 
############## Steps to Execute ##############
Part A
In the intial part, a basic app displaying hello from pragna munagala and manimozhi ramasamy! was created. 

Part B
When the app is opened, the webcamera acts as the front camera of the Nexus 4 emulator. When a point on the image is touched, the coordinates of the point and colour at that pixel 
is displayed using basic touch functionality.

Part C
Objective:
**********
Objective of part C is to add functionality to the existing colour touch App, we add 4 image processing features namely:
1)Canny filtering
2)Sobel filtering
3)Histogram plot
4)Zoom In
Objective is to get familiar with basic image manipulations in Android OpenCV. These features are chosen as they are the basic image manipulation features for high end applications.

New Features Added:
*******************
1)Canny filtering
2)Sobel filtering
3)Histogram plot
4)Zoom In

Application:
************
In the field of computer vision histogram plays an important role in edge detection, segmentation and co-occurrence matrices. Histogram is a representation of pixel distribution 
as a function of tonal variation, the peaks and the valleys can be analysed using histogram.
Sobel and Canny filtering are used in edge detection, image categorization, image registration, image visualization, and pattern recognition. They can be used in detecting abnormal 
cell or tumor in medical images, or detection of vehicles in the automatic road toll system.
Zoom is the basic feature and mostly used functionality to see a specific part of the image. The object at a far distance can also be captured with good focus.

Procedure to execute the code:
*****************************
1)Follow the installation of android studio provided in the project description.
2)created virtual Nexus 4 device as per the instructions in the project guide.
3)Open the part c code of the project.
4)Click run button (Select the installed virtual device as the android emulator)
5)The app will automatically open with colour touch feature.
6)On top right corner you can find 3 vertical dots- On clicking that you will find 4 menu options namely
	*Sobel filtering
	*Canny filtering
	*Histogram plot
	*Zoom In
7)Click on sobel filtering -> the screen displays the edges detected by sobel edge detector
8)Click on Canny filtering -> the screen displays the edges detected by Canny edge detector
9)Click on Histogram plot -> The screen displays the histogram of the image captured by the camera.
9)Click on zoom In -> the screen displays the camera caputured image and a subwindow of zoomed image. Any part of the image that falls on the red rectangular box will be zoomed and
diplayed in the zoom window on the screen.

Project contribution:
********************
Pragna Munagala:
Pragna implemented the sobel filtering and histogram plot of the part c code. She was also responsible for the object, application and part A, b description in the readMe file.

Manimozhi Ramasamy:
Manimozhi implemented the Canny filtering and Zoom In part of the part C code. She was also responsible for the procedure to executed the code, project contributions and outputs in 
the readME file.

############## Output ##############
for part a and part b we have provide the screenshots of the input and output image.
for part c the sample input, sample output and a screen recording of the project execution is provided.


############## System Used ##############
Microsoft Windows 10
Visual Studio 2015
